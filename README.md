Free and Open Artifact Development Project (FOAD-Project for short) is a non-profit creation project. We are committed to bringing together programmers, artists, scientists, and other technical personnel to jointly create the creations that humans need.
造物的范围很广泛。它包括但不限于程序、机械、艺术品、文学作品、行业标准。

Creation has a wide range. It includes but is not limited to programs, machinery, artwork, literature, industry standards.

# Workflow/协作方式
FOAD-Project使用完全可追溯的协作方式。从功能提案到代码维护，每一步都使用指定的可追溯的工具，这将确保开发工作的透明且有条理。除此之外，我们也制定了一系列标准，这些标准通常不会干涉编程自由，旨在贯彻FOAD-Project的开放性与自由性。这些标准将存放在Standards目录下。

FOAD-Project uses a fully traceable collaborative approach. From feature proposal to code maintenance, each step uses specified traceable tools, which will ensure that the development work is transparent and organized. In addition, we have also formulated a series of standards, which usually do not interfere with programming freedom, and are designed to implement the openness and freedom of FOAD-Project. These standards will be stored in the Standards directory.
